# `countrycode` for Python

`countrycode` standardizes country names, converts them into ~40 different coding schemes, and assigns region descriptors.

Convert country names to and from 9 country code schemes.

* Bugs & Development: https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/pycountrycode
* Pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/countrycode
* [Vincent's webpage](https://arelbundock.com)

This is a Python port of [the `countrycode` package for R.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode) 

## The Problem

Different data sources use different coding schemes to represent countries (e.g. CoW or ISO). This poses two main problems: (1) some of these coding schemes are less than intuitive, and (2) merging these data requires converting from one coding scheme to another, or from long country names to a coding scheme.

## The Solution

The `countrycode` function can convert to and from 40+ different country coding schemes, and to 600+ variants of country names in different languages and formats. It uses regular expressions to convert long country names (e.g. Sri Lanka) into any of those coding schemes or country names. It can create new variables with various regional groupings.
